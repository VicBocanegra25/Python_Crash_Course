Projects for Python Crash Course Book

This is the first complete project that I'll be working with.
It uses pygame to build a game called Alien Invasion.
In Alien invasion, a player uses a rocketship that moves up and down using the
arrow keys. It shoots bullets using the spacebar.
It's objective is to destroy a fleet of aliens that appear at the right side of the
screen.
The aliens move towards the player. If the aliens touch the spaceship or they reach the other side of the screen, the player loses a 'life'.
If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet of aliens appears (but they're faster).
If the player loses all of his lives, the game is over and the player can choose whether he wants to quit the game or start again.

Keeps a track of the scoreboard, player's lives and level. 

To improve:
Add music, background effects (a space-like background), sound effects and grant the aliens the ability to shoot the player.
