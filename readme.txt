This is the first complete project that I'll be working with.
It uses pygame to build a game called Alien Invasion.
In Alien invasion, a player uses a rocketship that moves up and down using the
arrow keys. It shoots bullets using the spacebar.
Its objective is to destroy a fleet of aliens that appear at the right of the
screen.
The aliens can also shoot and they move towards the player. If the aliens touch
the player or they shoot the spaceship, the player loses a 'life'.
If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet of aliens appears (but
they're faster).
If the player loses all of his lives, the game is over and the player can choose
 if he wants to quit the game or start again.
